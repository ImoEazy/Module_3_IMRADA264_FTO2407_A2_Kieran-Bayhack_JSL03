A programming paradigm is an approach to solve problems using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. There are lots of programming languages that are known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms. Apart from varieties of programming languages, there are lots of paradigms to fulfill each and every demand.

Imperative Programming ;
- as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes how the program executes. Developers are more concerned with how to get an answer step by step. It comprises the sequence of command imperatives. In this, the order of execution is very important and uses both mutable and immutable data. Fortran, Java, C, C++ programming languages are examples of imperative programming.

Declarative Programming:
-as the name suggests is a type of programming paradigm that describes what programs to be executed. Developers are more concerned with the answer that is received. It declares what kind of results we want and leave programming language aside focusing on simply figuring out how to produce them. In simple words, it mainly focuses on end result. It expresses the logic of computation. Miranda, Erlang, Haskell, Prolog are a few popular examples of declarative programming.
